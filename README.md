## üìù Overview
This project is a web application that allows users to create, join, and support events related to the Burma Spring Revolution, a pro-democracy movement that opposes the military coup in Myanmar. The platform aims to raise awareness, solidarity, and funds for the cause, as well as to connect activists, organizers, and supporters from around the world.

Spring 2 Action platform is a full-stack web application that leverages modern technologies and services to create a user-friendly and functional platform for organizing and supporting events related to the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar. The project demonstrates the use of Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, and other tools to create a fast, scalable, and secure web application. The project also showcases the integration of various third-party services, such as Clerk, Stripe, and Shadcn, to provide authentication, payment, and messaging features. The project is a tribute to the brave and resilient people of Myanmar who are fighting for their freedom and democracy.
